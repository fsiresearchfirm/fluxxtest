# FLUXX Engine  

## 🔮 Overview  
The **FLUXX Engine** is an experimental framework for recursive intelligence, symbolic MODs, and the **Sovereign Recursive Signal Engine (SRSE)**.  
It combines technical simulation with symbolic exploration — bridging code, ritual frameworks, and creative exposés.

## 🎯 Goals  
- 🗂 Document a **MOD Registry**  
- ⚙️ Build the **Sovereign Recursive Signal Engine (SRSE)**  
- 📜 Publish **scrolls/exposés** (technical + symbolic writeups)  
- 🃏 Maintain symbolic & technical decks (Codemaster, Tower Deck, Joy Deck, etc.)
